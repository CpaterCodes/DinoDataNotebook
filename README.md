# Walking with Data (On Dinosaurs): Notes on rationale and setup

## Overview

For this project, I wanted to give an overview of non-avian dinosaurs, their
diversity and some overall trends in their evolution. Being a lifelong
enthusiast of ancient life and having learnt to use Jupyter notebooks and 
related data processing/visualisation libraries during my MSc studies, I
wanted to walk through data regarding various species and visualise some key
observations.

## Tools and Objectives

Due to the convenient availability of comprehensive data on various species,
I've made use of The Exhaustive Dinosaur Dataset from Kaggle, which can be
found [here.](
https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/kjanjua/jurassic-park-the-exhaustive-dinosaur-dataset
)

Needless to say, the `notebook` library is utilised to run the notebook.
Various data processing/visualisation libraries will be used to explore the
data.

It is also intended that this notebook shall be successfully deployable with
Terraform/AWS, with the code and instructions to deploy the project also 
being made available in this repository.

## Conclusion

I am hoping this project will be an interesting exercise as much in the 
diversity and evolution of the non-avian dinosaurs as in the development
and deployment of data visualisations.
