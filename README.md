# Walking with Data (On Dinosaurs): Notes on rationale and setup

## Overview

For this project, I wanted to give an overview of non-avian dinosaurs, their
diversity and some overall trends in their evolution. Being a lifelong
enthusiast of ancient life I wanted to walk through data regarding various 
species and visualise some key observations through a Jupyter Notebook.

## Tools and Objectives

Due to the convenient availability of comprehensive data on various species,
I've made use of The Exhaustive Dinosaur Dataset from Kaggle, which can be
found [here.](
https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/kjanjua/jurassic-park-the-exhaustive-dinosaur-dataset
)

Needless to say, the `notebook` library is utilised to run the notebook.
Various data processing/visualisation libraries will be used to explore the
data.
 
It is also intended that this notebook shall be deployed in future.

## Further Notes 

The notebook will continue to be expanded and rewritten as new information
is sourced and new insights are found upon which to elaborate.

Setup instructions are also pending.
